This is the ant build file for the Global Climate Dashboard Drupal Module.

You do not normally need to use this build file; the project comes with a
compiled and production-ready copy of the Global Climate Dashboard
app in the "html5-app" subdirectory.

You can, however, use this ant build file to rebuild the app from
source (located in the submodules/global-climate-dashboard directory)
and replace the copy in the html5-app directory with the newly built
copy.

Before running this ant build file, you should make sure that the source
code to the Global Climate Dashboard app is checked out into
the submodules/global-climate-dashboard directory; you can do that
by giving the command:

  git submodule update ==init ==recursive

where each '=' is really a '-', but the command is represented with '='
here (because a sequence of two '-' chars isn't allowed in comments
in an ant build (or any XML) file).

Then run `ant build` to perform the rebuild.
